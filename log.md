# 100 Days of Code - Round 1 in 2020
## Day 1 - February 27. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I made progress in the 3rd Milestone of [OOP - TicTacToe](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop) game in Ruby! Also The 2nd Milestone got approved by the [Microverse Team](https://www.microverse.org/).

**Thoughts:** I need to make full commitment to this program again.

## Day 2 - February 28. Friday

**Today's Progress:** My 3rd Milestone was approved!!! But I needed to fix some bugs beforehand and to reorganize the files (each class in a different file). Only the 4th Milestone is left and I plan to finish it on weekend.

**Thoughts:** Now that I'm working alone I'm going faster but I need the skill to collaborate with others so I can't wait to finish this Course to request another partner.

## Day 3 - March 18. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** My capstone project for the *Microverse Ruby Course* has been approved!!! I finished all the details requested by the TSEs and started working on my Professional Skills so I can start with *Databases*

**Thoughts:** I forget about posting here the last half month, and even if I did was coding the whole time I won't cheat and skip days here :muscle: (and I forget what I did the other days :grimacing:)
